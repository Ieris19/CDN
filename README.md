# Ieris19 - CDN

A content delivery network is a web address that serves resources through a link. 

This means that a URL will provide the requested file whenever it is resolved through the internet.

Github links are resolved to the website, which is not what's desired in this case, however, 
with [JSDeliver](https://www.jsdelivr.com/github), you can turn a repository in GitHub into a CDN.

This repository is split mainly into two different sections. The first one, mirror, contains files
that I wish to mirror. This implies that I do not own them and thus, their corresponding licenses 
will be hosted beside these files. The second part, assets, contains files that I have created myself.
All of this assets are shared under the same license, which you can find within that directory in
the repository. This is a useful project but there's not much happening here
